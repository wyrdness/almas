      "summary": "A wildman creature reported from Central Asia, particularly Mongolia and the Caucasus Mountains. Described as 5-6.5 feet tall with reddish-brown hair and human-like features, some researchers theorize it could represent surviving Neanderthal populations.",
      "full": "The Almas (also Almasty) is a humanoid cryptid reported from the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including Mongolia, the Caucasus, Pamir Mountains, and Altai Mountains. Described as standing 5-6.5 feet tall, covered in reddish-brown hair with a more human-like face than ape-like, featuring a pronounced brow ridge. The creature is generally described as shy and avoiding human contact. The most famous case involves Zana, an alleged female Almas captured in the 1850s in Abkhazia who lived among humans and reportedly bore children with human features. DNA analysis in 2013 of Zana's descendants was inconclusive but suggested possible sub-Saharan African ancestry. The Almas phenomenon has connections to historical accounts including possible references by Marco Polo to wildmen in Central Asia."
